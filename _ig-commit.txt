-made so detects if scrollbars vis on PUIcs, if its NOT vis then it wont hide them and do nothing on collapse, if it IS vis then it will hide them then reshow on collapse
-:todo:it looks like expandedHeight should be cumHeight - 1 but i didnt implement this
-:todo:watch out for content of stack showing someday, right now even with not specifying overflow:hidden the contents of stack doesnt show if the height is set to something less than max height
-:bug: possible bug to report to bugzilla: if panel is visible and if stack is empty and stack is set to height of 38px, its weird but the box comes out to be 50px;. no matter what if stack empty set stack to whatever height, the box is always stack height + 12 UNTIL you put a child into stack, weird
-:learned: when trying to put a ProflistLoading id'ed toolbarbutton into stack it woundnt get added when first letter was caps
-tested to see how it works when os.file lags, by using settimeout and what if stack was expanded, it is modified approparately now
-fixed: bug, to see if the stackJSON value was in pathsInIni it was doing m.props.profName in profToolkit.pathsInIni, but pathsInIni is an array so I have to use indexOf
-i accidentally had a typo in the collapse function, there was a z in front of the line that set the height back to collapsedHeight, this just happend today while i was working, was not there in prior versions
-:learned: if add dynamically createElement and then add it to a panel thats hidden, and while its hidden (meaning state has never been showing or open since you added the element), if you do boxObject.height or window.getComputedStyle(el).getPropertyValue('height') they will return 0. this is true even if you set el.style.height to say '38px' after adding the element, you can read this '38px' though by going el.style.height.
-:learned: if add dynamically createElement and then add it to a panel thats hidden, and then open the panel (in my testing i ran getComputed and boxObject on it, but i think the following is true even if you dont run getComputed or boxObject on the element while the panel was showing/open), and then close the panel, then if you go boxObject.height or window.getComputedStyle(el).getPropertyValue('height') it will return to you the LAST KNEW, meaning the height it was when the panel was last open. so after its closed even if you set el.style.height to '38px' and run boxObject or getComputedStyle it will still return to you the last known height (again: last known is when it was last open), you can get this string value of style.height though by going el.style.height
-:learned: boxObject always returns unitless so its just a number but the units are always px
-:learned: getComputedStyle always returns with units and i suspect its the units used by the css style applied (if no css style changed the height then it will default to 'px' i suspect)
-:learned: boxObject is rounded value while getComputedStyle gives float value like if el.boxObject.height gives you 38px window.getComputedStyle(el).getPropertyValue('height') will be anything from 37.5px-38.4px
-:todo: im thinking because right now (as i dont have access to file watcher) im always refreshingIni on show of popup, if after running create/delete/rename profile promise complete if the panel is open then refresh, if its not open then dont refresh
-fixed: in `updateStackDOMJson_basedOnToolkit` it was splicing in every time, i corrected the if, im pretty sure its a bug fix, so it only splices if pos of path was -1 in stackJSON, i think this fixes the duplicate triplicate bug i just saw within the last hour of 1:37am
-fixed: when renaming, in revamped method, if open menu, its still reading file, and before it finishes i go to rename and rename a profile, then toolbarbutton is blank in all windows for this renamed profile
-chagned so identifier is path in ini for toolbarbuttons for profile buttons and just the label name for non profile buttons
-partially revamped `updateStackDOMJson_basedOnToolkit` and `updateMenuDOM`, now it always runs updateMenuDOM and figs if it needs a dom update, if it does and find dont update stack is true then it reports so.
-also fixed if open new window it will properly update the menu
