when panel is popupshowing do this:
1. gets `PanelUI` dom element by taking from either `e` or `aDOMWindow` [ELEMENT]
{i added this in when following the notes}1b. check if profilist is in window, if not then insert loading
2. determines if `PUIsync_height` has been declared, and if it wasnt then it figures it out and declares it
3. gets `stack` dom element from `PanelUI` [ELEMENT]
4. makes sure `collapsedheight` is delcared as `PUIsync_height`
5. makes `stack` to `collapsedheight` if it isnt necessary
6. readIni
	6a. if ini is not touched by profilist, readIniBkp
		6a-i. if IniBkp doesnt exist then touch IniObj and go on, async start writeIniBkp [PENDING: write IniObj]
		6a-ii. if it exists then read it into IniObj [PENDING: write IniObj]
	6b. if touched then go on
7. do post readIni stuff {doing this in readIniAndParseObjs, except for the initProfToolkit part}
	7a. make sure constants in profToolkit exist [DO NOT DO, move this to startup]
	7b. update prefs with setVal {what i actually did when following these notes: moved this to readIniAndParseObjs}
		7b-i. if a pref is not found in ini, then use whatever value is currently in config system and update IniObj.General [PENDING: write IniObj] {doing this in readIniAndParseObjs}
	7c. if dev mode is enabled maybe do checkIfIconIsRight here
	7d. Maybe get name of selectedProfile {havent done this yet, deciding if should do in readIniAndParseObjs}
		7d-i. if path of current profile not in found in ini, then mark active as "Temporary Profile"
	{added}7e. figured out default profile, and if one is selected
8. create json.stringify of ini with just prefs and and profile info that affects panel dom {doing this in readIniAndParseObjs}
9. check windows panel dom json, if it matches, the do nothing, if its different then update, and update windows panel dom json object
	9a. if it has no old json, then need to insert profilistHBoxJSON and set up `mouseenter` and `mouseleave` stuff
10. update running icons
11. if diabled from customize, then re-enable
